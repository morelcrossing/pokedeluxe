# Pokémon Deluxe

This is a hack of Pokémon Yellow that aims to add both visual and gameplay improvements. It's built off of the disassembly project of Pokémon Yellow.

To set up the repository, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md).

# Current Features

* Species specific party icons
* Updated all 151 front sprites, with species specific colour palette
* Any Pokémon in the 1st party slot now always follows behind the player on the overworld. All 151 pokemon currently have their own overworld sprites, but this is still a W.I.P.
* All Pokémon names have been changed to be capitalized correctly
* All Pokémon are able to be obtained without glitches or other versions (Pokémon missing from yellow have been re-added to their original wild areas from red or blue)
